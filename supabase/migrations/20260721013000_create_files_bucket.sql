-- Storage pattern (builder pack, data-auth module): one private bucket
-- "files". Only signed-in users can touch it — and under owner-only auth,
-- the only signed-in user is the owner. Downloads use signed URLs; a
-- private bucket has no public links.
--
-- Note: no `alter table storage.objects ...` here — RLS is already enabled
-- on storage tables, and migrations don't own them (the statement would
-- fail with "must be owner").

-- The policies are wrapped so a platform permission change can never abort
-- the deploy — this file doubles as the migration that proves the
-- GitHub-linked deploy on an app's first push, and it must stay green.
-- (supabase/supabase#41126 reports CREATE POLICY on storage.objects being
-- refused to the migration role on some projects; see the builder pack's
-- known-issues entry.) If the block is skipped, the bucket exists but stays
-- locked for everyone until policies are added by a later migration.
